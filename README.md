# Facial Emotional Recognition Using Keras

In this paperwork, the training of the FER 2013 data set, which contains seven classes, is explained in detail. “angry”, “disgust”, “fear”, “happy”, “neutral”, “sad” and “surprised”. In total, there are over 10,000 images for training.
Recognition of facial expressions can be used for many purposes, such as checking a person's mood and in some cases when we want to test a person when we give him something as a gift, etc. Despite the fact that deep learning is still a young branch of science with Keras framework we can achieve very good performance with very little code.
